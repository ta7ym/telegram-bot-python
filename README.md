- Echoes all other messages
- Uses telebot for bot functionality
- Uses Poetry for dependency management
- Easy to understand and extend

## Setup

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

## Develop

To run the bot locally:

```bash
poetry run python -B main.py
```

Make sure to set up your `.env` file with your Telegram bot token:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Deploy
